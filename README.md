Simple program to read pdf files aloud

This program is still in its infancy, it can read "most" pdf files aloud, some it can't read at all. There are different breeds of pdf's I guess.

Future upgrades:
  * Add graphic user interface
  * Add file chooser
  * Allow user to choose different voices
  * Handle exceptions in text to voice better
